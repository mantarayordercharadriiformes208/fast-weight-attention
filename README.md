## Fast Weight Attention

An attention based fast weight episodic memory, in the same vein as the memory MLP from TTT / [Titans](https://codeberg.org/lucidrains/titans-pytorch) and [fast weight PKM](https://codeberg.org/lucidrains/fast-weight-product-key-memory) from Sakana AI

## Install

```bash
$ pip install fast-weight-attention
```

## Usage

```python
import torch
from fast_weight_attention import FastWeightAttention

mem = FastWeightAttention(512, causal = True)

tokens = torch.randn(1, 64, 512)

past_mem = None

retrieved, next_mem = mem(tokens, past_mem = past_mem, return_next_memories = True)
retrieved, next_mem = mem(tokens, past_mem = next_mem, return_next_memories = True)
retrieved, next_mem = mem(tokens, past_mem = next_mem, return_next_memories = True)

assert retrieved.shape == tokens.shape

# you can then retrieve without fast weight updating

retrieved = mem(tokens, return_next_memories = False)
```

With chunked processing (automatically segments the sequence and carries memory across chunks):

```python
import torch
from fast_weight_attention import ChunkedFastWeightAttention

mem = ChunkedFastWeightAttention(
    512,
    causal = True,
    chunk_size = 64   # process 64 tokens at a time, carrying fast weight memories across chunks
)

tokens = torch.randn(1, 512, 512)

retrieved, next_mem = mem(tokens, return_next_memories = True)

assert retrieved.shape == tokens.shape
```
